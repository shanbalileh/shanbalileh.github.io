                                    Doom and Bloom is a multiplayer game created in a team of 6 for a 10-week long systems design and networking class. There were two requirements for our project. The first was for the game to be real-time multiplayer (with 4 players),and 3D. The second was for the game to be coded from scratch, as in no game-engine allowed. This was intended as a instructive requirement to better glean the workings of designing a system. While I had some reservations at first, this experience proved to be immensely insightful. At the end, my teamates and I agreed that doing the game from scratch was worth it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The gameplay of the game is a 2v2 role-based area control game. Our inspiration was Splatoon (being one of our member's favorite game), but with plants/flowers. The goal of the game was to till the land, seeding it with your team's seeds, and then watering it for your flowers to grow. Players could also till over other player's seeded land and even their plants. However, flowers if left growing for a short amount of time will turn permanent. In addition, you could fight the enemy team by attacking them with water. However you'd have to be careflu not to water your enemy's seeded land. The roles were split into two: a seeder and a tiller with each having a different method of watering. The tiller's main goal was to till untilled land, and the enemy team's seeds and flowers. The tiller's water gun was a slow charging water ball that would grow in size and damage. The seeder's wtaer gun was a rapid fire of smaller water balls. At first, the water particle would simple water and damage anything hit within the radius of the particle or where it collides with the terrain. But then we had the idea (inspired by Splatoon's Splat Charger weapon) that anything below the path of the particle would also be watered. This meant that the tiller's fully charged water ball could water large parts of the land, in a very satisfying water line effect.

                                    My primary role on the team was graphics (along with 2 others) due to having a small amount of prior experience from a computer graphics class. For the first 2 weeks of class, I designed the classes for loading objects/moodels and textures with the Assimp library. Because we had no dedicated artist and none of us had any experience with 3D modeling, we all agreed to learn a bit about Blender during the first 2 weeks. Although we all did at least a tutorial in Blender, by the 3rd and 4th week it seemed that me and one other member were the most invested in working with Blender. As a result, my tasks shifted towards learning to rig, animate, and then implement animations for our character models. Because it my team member's first experience at creating a character and for me, my first time rigging and animating, we had lots of small hiccups along the way. Nonetheless, it was a fun learning experience and am still quite proud of the end result.

                                    MusicSpace is a high-fidelity wireframe of a music-streaming app. This project was developed in a team of 3 for a UX course at UC San Diego. For this project, our team utilized the design process to find particular components to redesign for existing popular music-streaming applications such as Spotify and Soundcloud. We performed a series of interviews of college students that regularly listen to music on their phone to understand the reasons why the user chose to use specific apps. From there, we formulated a list of scenarios to test and compare with various apps (some popular and some less so). We did a competitive analysis and created a sitemap for multiple applications and found that a better workflow could be produced with some minor adjustments.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For our wireframe, we decided to add the functionality of adding multiple sone from one playlist to another. From all the apps we examined, this was unavailable; current apps only allowed for this if the user were to do so one-by-one. Additionally, we changed the layout of the search. Many apps would show the results of a search for playlists in a list with a vertical-ellipsis menu. We found that this menu only provided some seemingly unnecessary features. While these features weren't entirely unuseful, it made little sense to place them there since the user would mostly likely not select those options unless they had listen to the playlist already--in which case they'd be on the next screen. From this, we removed this menu and listed the playlist results as a grid of pictures to remove clutter and create aesthetic appeal.
                                </p>

                                    My role was shared fairly equal among the team, in terms of actual creation of the wireframe; however, I focused on the user experience and both formulated and rationalized the above features.

                                    SciPlay was developed for a 10-week long project
                                    in a UX course at UC San Diego in a team of three students. During our process, our team was involved in conducting needfinding, creating storyboards and prototypes, wireframe, implementation and user-testing.

                                    We were provided with a topic Citizen Science and were tasked with needfinding  We completed our needfinding with a series of interviews and found that the issue with many existing citizen science projects was a lack of incentive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We were provided with a topic <a href="https://www.citizensciencealliance.org/">Citizen Science</a> and was tasked with following the design process. We completed our needfinding with a series of interviews on college students. Our interviews all consisted similarly as follows:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    1. Asked "Had they heard about citizen science?"
                                    <br>
                                    2. Described if they didn't know, what citizen science was.
                                    <br>
                                    3. Had subjects play a selection of existing citizen science projects.
                                    <br>
                                    4. Asked them their opinion on citizen science: the idea, the project they just partook in, would they partake again?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We compiled a list of needs and found the overarching issue with many existing citizen science projects was a lack of incentive. While many users thought the concept was interesting, their actual role when partaking in these projects was short-handed. Our point of view was then created: <strong>People quickly lose interest in citizen science applications due to their unrewarding nature.</strong>

                                    Our next step was to begin brainstorming for potential solutions. We came up with three ideas for our storyboards:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    1. A monetary or point reward system for completing tasks like a <strong>mechanical turk:  mturk.com</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    2. A fundraising website for completing tasks similar to <strong>freerice.com</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    3. A gamified app for completing tasks like <strong>habitica.com</strong>
                                </p>
                                <h4>Example of our storyboards:</h4>

                                    Following, we made two paper prototypes for our ideas. Here is a video showcasing one of them:

                                <p>
                                    We decided to create our web app as a gamified wrapper to other existing citizen science projects. Our site would allow the creation of an account to keep track of multiple projects. We implemented avatars, levels, experience, gold, items, and a leaderboard. My primary role was style and design of the website. I focused on the aesthetics and located image resources to use for our game. Additionally, I put into practice the technique of dynamically generating webpages via Handlebars. This way, all the project content (the citizen science apps we used), the images (avatars and items) could be managed and updated with ease. I solved issues that we came across in our user testing. We found that users could sometimes get lost and/or miss a button. In paritcular, users would often not change projects or do so without utilizing the button (which we had intended for them to use). I formulated a solution by removing the button and replacing it with a persistent sidebar so the users could always see the available projects to the side. Finally, we utilized A/B testing to perform a statistical analysis of this change. We concluded, that we could reject the null hypothesis and the sidebar made a significant improvement.

                                    This project was one of my first Human Computer Interaction classes, and introduced me to the design process. I now better understand the importance of the process as a whole that enables me create a useful, working product that solved a need.

We realied there already exists many applications and extensions that help users track change in prices, but are limited to predefined sites. We wanted to develop an tool that can dynamically determine the desired element on a webpage and allow the user to set certain criteria for email notification. This way, our extension could track any element on any website. And it wouldn't be limited to just prices; we could track other things such as the number of students on waitlist for your class schedule. My role in the project was incorporating the web-scraping algorithm for the extension. Learn more at our Devpost <a href="https://devpost.com/software/promptify">here</a>.</p>
